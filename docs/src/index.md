# Introduction

## What is Guardrails?

Guardrails is a Python framework that helps build reliable AI applications by performing two key functions:
1. Guardrails runs Input/Output Guards in your application that detect, quantify and mitigate the presence of specific types of risks. To look at the full suite of risks, check out [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/).
2. Guardrails help you generate structured data from LLMs.

### Guardrails Hub

Guardrails Hub is a collection of pre-built measures of specific types of risks (called 'validators'). Multiple validators can be combined together into Input and Output Guards that intercept the inputs and outputs of LLMs. Visit [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/) to see the full list of validators and their documentation.
